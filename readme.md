# Taskrr - a Task Sourcing Web Application
## Module Project for CS2102, NUS School of Computing
This is a task matching application (e.g., https://www.taskrabbit.com) to facilitate users to hire temporary help to complete certain tasks.
Tasks are general chores as such washing a car at Kent Vales car park on Sunday or delivering a parcel on Tuesday between 17:00 and 19:00.
Users of this application are either looking for help to complete some task or bidding to complete some freelance task.
The application provides templates for generic common tasks to facilitate task requesters to create new tasks.
The successful bidder for a task is chosen by the task requester.
Each user has an account, and administrators can create/modify/delete entries.
